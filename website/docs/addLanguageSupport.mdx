title: Add Language Support

A good place to start looking at is here: https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster/blob/33f274c030015bb555824d5ba7a4c1b11776257a/app/src/Test/TesterFactory/TesterFactory.ts

where you will find that we have three main clases that represent `compiled`, `interpreted` and `mixed` languages.

### Interpreted

Usually, all interpreted languages have the same syntax to run a file:

```shell
interpreter filename.[extension]
```

e.g.

```shell
$ python filename.py
$ ruby filename.rb
$ node filname.js
...
```

therefore, `cpbooster` should support absolutely all `interpreted` languages.

The issue comes when we use either `compiled` or `interpreted` languages, specifically
when it comes to indicate the name for the executable (binary) file.

### Compiled

Compilers like `gcc`, `clang`, `rustc`, `go`, ... use the `-o` argument to indicate
the name for the executable file.

e.g.

```shell
gcc filename.cpp -o myexecutable.exe
go build filename.go -o myexecutable.exe
rustc filename.rs -o myexecutable.exe
...
```

However, there might exist some other compilers that do not follow this convention and they
probably use a different argument, to solve this we have the following function

```ts
static getFileNameOptionForCompilerCommand(compilerCommand: string): string {
  return CompiledTester.fileNameOptionForCommand.get(compilerCommand) ?? "-o";
}
```

https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster/blob/33f274c030015bb555824d5ba7a4c1b11776257a/app/src/Test/TesterFactory/CompiledTester.ts#L111-L113

which uses a `Map` (hash table)
to retrieve the correct argument name depending on the compiler command (`gcc`, `g++`, `csc`, `go`, ...),
if the compiler does not exist in the hash table (`Map`) it defaults to the `-o` argument name.

```ts
private static fileNameOptionForCommand: Map<string, string> = new Map([
  [NonStandardCompilers.mcs, "-out:"], // csharp compiler
  [NonStandardCompilers.csc, "/out:"] // csharp compiler
]);
```

https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster/blob/33f274c030015bb555824d5ba7a4c1b11776257a/app/src/Test/TesterFactory/CompiledTester.ts#L37-L40

notice that in the hash table (`Map`) we just have `msc` and `csc` which are `C#` compilers, this is because
all the tested languages except for `C#` use the `-o` argument therefore there is no need to insert them into the hash table.

Now let's actually talk about `C#` compilers and how they conflict with the standard format. It turns out that these compilers
not just use a different argument name to sepecify the executable name, but they also force us to write the name of the executable
together with the argument name (i.e. not separated by a space)

e.g.

```shell
mcs -out:myexecutable.exe filename.cs
csc /out:myexecutable.exe filename.cs
```

to solve this when we compile we have an special condition, which basically checks if the compiler is NOT standard (i.e. `csc` and `mcs`)
then join/concatenate the argument name with the executable name.

```ts
if (Object.keys(NonStandardCompilers).includes(compilerCommand)) {
  args.push(
    CompiledTester.getFileNameOptionForCompilerCommand(compilerCommand) +
      this.getDefaultExecutableFileName(debug)
  );
} else {
  args.push(
    CompiledTester.getFileNameOptionForCompilerCommand(compilerCommand),
    this.getDefaultExecutableFileName(debug)
  );
}
```

```ts
export enum NonStandardCompilers {
  mcs = "mcs",
  csc = "csc",
}
```

https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster/blob/33f274c030015bb555824d5ba7a4c1b11776257a/app/src/Test/TesterFactory/CompiledTester.ts#L31-L34

### Mixed

`mixed` languages are the ones that are compiled with one command but executed with another one (not counting `./executable.exe` format as command)
e.g. programs written in `Java` are compiled using the `javac` command and then executed using the `java` command, something similar
happens with languages like `Kotlin` and `Scala`.

Usually, these languages generate a `.class` file after compilation, this `.class` file usually has the same name as the source file name or
the same name as the `class` declared inside it. `cpbooster` takes advantage of this behavior and therefore, no extra code is written to name
the executables (`.class` files), except for `kotlin` which adds `Kt` to the executable name, we have that case covered with a simple `if`
condition here:

```ts
getExecutableFileName(): string {
  return `${this.getExecutableFileNameNoExtension()}${
    this.langExtension === LangExtensions.kotlin ? "Kt" : ""
  }.class`;
}
```

https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster/blob/33f274c030015bb555824d5ba7a4c1b11776257a/app/src/Test/TesterFactory/MixedTester.ts#L36

:::note
Currently, to guarantee the correct behavior of `cpbooster`, the `class` name should match with the source file name, since
some languages use the `class` name as the executable (`.class`) name instead of the source file name.

Which leads to a possible **contribution** related with the "templates" for languages that require the declaration of a class.
We can add the concept of `cpbooster-variables` which will be formatted strings that will get replaced with some information,
like filename or date, etc

e.g.

###### `template.java`

```java
/**
 * Date Time: $${DateTime}$$
 */

import java.util.*;

public class $${FileName}$$   <-- just a suggested syntax not sure if its the best
{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

    }
}
```

then if we create a file `ProblemC.java` with `cpbooster` the file will look like this:

```java
/**
 * DateTime: 13-07-2022 13:30      <-- $${DateTime}$$ was replaced with the "current" date time
 */

import java.util.*;

public class ProblemC     <-- $${FileName}$$ was replaced with ProblemC
{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

    }
}
```

one thing to note here is that we will also need to force the file name to have the first letter capitalized (in uppercase),
since some `mixed` languages do not allow to create classes that do not have the first letter in uppercase.

`cpbooster` uses terminal commands to open editors, which can be either other terminals
or common editors like _vscode_ or _sublime text_. You can find an example of the supported
editors in the following file
https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster/blob/master/app/src/Clone/TerminalCommandBuilder.ts

To add another editor you need to investigate how to launch it specifying the working directory
from a terminal command, then just add the proper command in the `switch` statement as shown in the image.

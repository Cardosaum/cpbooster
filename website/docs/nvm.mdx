### About

> nvm is a version manager for node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell.
> nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms:
> unix, macOS, and windows WSL.

### Installation

Run any of the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

Running either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. The script clones the nvm repository to
`~/.nvm`, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file
(`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).

### Verify Installation

To verify that nvm has been installed, do:

```sh
command -v nvm
```

which should output `nvm` if the installation was successful.
Please note that `which nvm` will not work, since `nvm` is a
sourced shell function, not an executable binary.

### Usage

To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:

```sh
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
```

And then in any new shell just use the installed version:

```sh
nvm use node
```
